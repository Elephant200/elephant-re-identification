# AlphaPhant Context

AlphaPhant is a fully automated catalog-matching algorithm for elephant re-identification. Given a high-quality image of each ear, it returns one similarity score per known elephant without further human input. A candidate ranking is the descending view of those scores.

This glossary is the canonical source for domain and technical language. Implementation plans and specifications live in the other top-level docs.

## Sightings and Catalog

**Sighting**:
An immutable snapshot of one observed event, grouping its distinct photo assets under a permanent opaque sighting ID. Its date is required observation metadata used for time-gap research; the elephant may be unknown until a later identity decision.
_Avoid_: Identity, elephant, match

**Photo**:
One immutable original photo asset belonging to a sighting, represented throughout the system only by its permanent opaque photo ID and parent sighting ID. It carries no known-elephant identity, storage location, date, filename, or encoded bytes.
_Avoid_: Image when referring to the domain object

**Photo ID**:
The permanent opaque identifier of one immutable original photo asset. Replacing or re-encoding the original bytes creates a new photo ID.
_Avoid_: Filename, path, content hash

**Sighting ID**:
The permanent opaque identifier of one observed event, independent of elephant identity, date, and its photo IDs.
_Avoid_: Elephant-and-date identifier

**Photo store**:
The storage capability that resolves a Photo to its original encoded bytes without exposing known-elephant identity. A research dataset or application library may own a photo store.
_Avoid_: Dataset, identity resolver

**Dataset**:
The private research dataset object that owns metadata, known-elephant resolution, and a PhotoStore.
_Avoid_: Historical data access, data layer

**Sighting ear pair**:
The selected evidence for one sighting: its opaque sighting ID, one high-quality left-ear Photo, and one high-quality right-ear Photo. Both Photos belong to that sighting; one source Photo may supply both sides.
_Avoid_: Curated sighting, synthetic sighting, cross-sighting pair

**Known elephant**:
An individual elephant already represented in the reference catalog.
_Avoid_: Sighting, folder

**Known-elephant catalog**:
The reference evidence grouped by known elephant and ear side for matching.
_Avoid_: Gallery when naming the domain concept

**Candidate catalog**:
The query-specific view of reference evidence supplied to a catalog matcher, grouped under opaque candidate keys. Every listed candidate has one or more sighting ear pairs.
_Avoid_: Dataset, gallery, ranked candidates

**Candidate key**:
An ephemeral opaque UUID assigned to one matching candidate for one call to `evaluate`. It is stable across that evaluation's query folds and carries no known-elephant identity.
_Avoid_: Known-elephant name, photo ID, sighting ID

**Matching candidate**:
A known elephant for which a catalog matcher returns a candidate score.
_Avoid_: Identity decision, automatic identification

**Catalog matcher**:
A complete retrieval algorithm that compares one sighting ear pair with a candidate catalog and returns one comparable similarity score for every matching candidate. AlphaPhant, CurvRank, and MiewID are catalog matchers.
_Avoid_: Candidate scorer, ranker when referring to the catalog-matching role

**Candidate scores**:
The complete association of matching candidates with finite similarity floats for one query. Larger scores indicate stronger matches, and every catalog candidate appears exactly once.
_Avoid_: Ranking, probabilities, confidence labels

## AlphaPhant Algorithm

**Sighting analysis**:
The processing of a sighting ear pair into left- and right-ear tear profiles for catalog matching.
_Avoid_: Per-photo identification, SEEK coding

**Ear preparation**:
The shared processing that retrieves and decodes a photo, segments its ears, detects landmarks, and constructs immutable prepared-ear geometry. `SightingPreparer` prepares both declared sides. AlphaPhant then extracts its own tear profiles, while CurvRank and MiewID derive their own representations. All compared catalog matchers use the same preparation computation.

**Depth change**:
The difference between neighboring tear-profile depths. Its magnitude describes how abruptly the profile changes.

**Signed depth change**:
Depth change represented by separate nonnegative rising and falling components. This preserves whether a tear profile rises or falls at a position. It does not add negative tear depths.

**Shared scale alignment**:
One angular shift and stretch applied to every extraction scale within a comparison channel. The depth and depth-change channels can select different alignments.

**Catalog background similarity**:
The mean of an ear's ten strongest outgoing similarities to other ears of the same side in the current catalog. It measures how broadly that catalog ear matches. The query sighting is absent from this calculation.

**Similarity-weighted evidence mean**:
A mean over one candidate's same-side sighting scores, with greater weight on stronger scores. It combines available evidence while limiting the influence of weak views. Its temperature is the standard deviation of all corrected catalog scores for that side and query.

**Ear localization**:
The determination of where a left or right ear appears in a photo.
_Avoid_: Ear segmentation when referring only to location

**Ear segmentation**:
The extraction of an ear mask and its ear contour from a localized ear.
_Avoid_: Ear localization, body segmentation

**Ear landmark detection**:
The location of the two anatomical endpoints that define the relevant ear contour. Code may call these endpoints the upper anchor and lower anchor.
_Avoid_: Anchor detection in technical writing

**Ear contour**:
The ordered boundary of an ear mask used for tear-profile extraction.
_Avoid_: Ear margin when referring to the computational representation

**Alpha shape**:
The geometric reference constructed from an ear contour during tear-profile extraction.
_Avoid_: Alpha hull

**AlphaTear**:
The current tear-profile extraction algorithm. It uses an alpha shape as an internal geometric reference to locate and measure tears along a prepared ear contour. AlphaTear names the extractor; AlphaPhant names the complete catalog-matching algorithm.
_Avoid_: AlphaPhant when referring only to extraction

**AlphaPhant**:
The project's complete catalog-matching algorithm, which analyzes a sighting ear pair, compares its tear profiles with catalog evidence, and returns candidate scores.
_Avoid_: AlphaTear, AlphaPhant matcher

**Tear profile**:
A one-dimensional, alpha-shape-derived representation of an ear contour used for matching.
_Avoid_: Tear signature, SEEK code, embedding when referring to the current algorithm

**Tear-profile extraction**:
The transformation of a prepared ear contour into a tear profile. AlphaTear is the current extraction algorithm.
_Avoid_: Tear coding, tear-signature extraction

**Tear-profile matching**:
The computation of a similarity score between ears using their alpha-shape-derived tear profiles.
_Avoid_: SEEK matching, tear-signature matching

**Similarity score**:
A numeric measure of how strongly two ears, or a sighting and known elephant, match under the current algorithm.
_Avoid_: Probability, confidence

**Candidate ranking**:
The descending view of candidate scores. Ranking adds no scientific result beyond the scores and is not a separate catalog-matching module.
_Avoid_: Identity decision, prediction

## Evaluation

**Curation splits**:
The benchmark, tuning, and model groups of elephant identities. Every sighting and photo of an assigned elephant belongs to the same group, although only selected evidence is used. An elephant without an assignment belongs to none of the three.

**Photo quality grade**:
A retained assessment of a photo's visible ear evidence, with independent grades for each assessed side and an image score reflecting its best ear. One good ear is sufficient; a poor opposite ear does not reduce its value. Grades are independent of curation split and reused when selections expand.
_Avoid_: Retrieval score, identity confidence

**Retrieval benchmark set**:
The fixed private sample of real sighting ear pairs used to estimate expected retrieval performance beyond the benchmark itself. It contains one pair per sampled sighting and is held under the gitignored research dataset at `dataset/elephants-alive/benchmark/`; shorten to benchmark set in running writing.
_Avoid_: Evaluation suite, test set

**Target deployment population**:
The broader population of elephants and sightings to which identity-retrieval evaluation is intended to generalize. An unseen elephant is unseen during system development but is represented by prior evidence in the catalog when queried.
_Avoid_: Benchmark set, available dataset

**Benchmark manifest**:
The identity-aware declaration of the benchmark set, with one row per selected sighting ear pair naming its known elephant, sighting ID, left photo ID, and right photo ID. It selects evidence by permanent IDs and never derives identity, grouping, or ear side from paths or filenames.
_Avoid_: Picker manifest, benchmark folders

**Parameter-tuning set**:
The set of sighting ear pairs used to compare AlphaPhant mechanisms and choose matching parameters. Its elephants are disjoint from both AI-model data and the retrieval benchmark set.
_Avoid_: Validation set, training set, dev set

**Tuning catalog A / tuning catalog B**:
Two catalogs formed from different elephants in the parameter-tuning set. Each has 89 elephants and the benchmark's sightings-per-elephant histogram. They are not subdivisions of the human-curated benchmark. A proposed enhancement must help in both before selection.
_Avoid_: Half A / Half B without explaining what was split

**AI-model datasets**:
The localization, ear-segmentation, and landmark datasets contain individual photos, which need not form sighting ear pairs, from an elephant-identity cohort disjoint from tuning and retrieval evaluation. Train, validation, and test roles are identity-disjoint and shared across models; all photos from a sighting stay together. These split terms name model data only; AlphaPhant has no training phase.

**Identity-retrieval evaluation**:
End-to-end estimation of how a complete retrieval system ranks the correct known elephant for previously unseen elephants and sightings from the target deployment population. Point estimates are unweighted over eligible queries; for uncertainty, elephants are the independent sampling unit and their sightings are nested observations.
_Avoid_: Model benchmark, stage-level evaluation

**Evaluation result**:
The scientific outcome of evaluating one catalog matcher against one retrieval benchmark. Its canonical evidence is the score for every known elephant for each eligible query; ranks, metrics, intervals, and eligibility summaries are derived views rather than separately recorded facts.
_Avoid_: Evaluation run, evaluation report

**Eligible query**:
A benchmark sighting used as a query because its elephant still has catalog evidence after that sighting is held out.
_Avoid_: Protocol-eligible query

**Ineligible query**:
A benchmark sighting omitted from the query denominator because its elephant has no remaining catalog sighting. Its evidence remains in other queries' catalogs.
_Avoid_: Protocol exclusion, Extraction failure

## Future Application

**Ear selection**:
The process of choosing one usable left-ear reference photo and one usable right-ear reference photo from all photos in a sighting.
_Avoid_: Matching, per-photo identification

**Ear candidate**:
One suggested ear evidence item before ear selection.
_Avoid_: Selected ear, matching candidate

**Review**:
The human step in which automated suggestions are accepted, corrected, or rejected.
_Avoid_: Verification when it implies a passive check

**Reviewer**:
The person who inspects evidence, compares candidates, and makes an identity decision.
_Avoid_: User when the review role matters

**Analysis package**:
A future application artifact containing sighting photos, automated evidence, selected ears, tear profiles, and correction state.
_Avoid_: SEEK record, raw model output

**Identity decision**:
A reviewer's decision to link a sighting to a known elephant, create a new known elephant, or leave the sighting unresolved.
_Avoid_: Candidate ranking, automatic match

**Unresolved sighting**:
A sighting whose intermediate analysis is saved without linking it to a known elephant.
_Avoid_: Failed sighting

A future app-controlled workspace containing imported photos, derived assets, and metadata.
_Avoid_: Source camera folder

**Import**:
The future application action that copies a grouped sighting into the App Library and assigns application identifiers.
_Avoid_: Upload when no network transfer occurs

## Legacy Language

**Coding**:
Wording from the SEEK-centered era. Current work uses analysis, tear-profile extraction, matching, candidate ranking, and identity decision.
_Avoid_: Use as a current workflow term
