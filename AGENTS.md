# Agent Guidelines

## Project

AlphaPhant is a fully automated catalog-matching algorithm for elephant re-identification. Given one high-quality image of each ear from the same sighting, it localizes and segments the ears, detects anatomical landmarks, extracts alpha-shape-derived tear profiles, and returns one similarity score per known elephant. Candidate ranking is the descending view of those scores.

## Start Here

- Exploring deferred research only: read [docs/future.md](docs/future.md).
- Analysis or matching behavior: read [docs/pipeline.md](docs/pipeline.md).
- Retrieval evaluation, splits, failures, or metrics: read [docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md).
- Module placement, domain/storage boundaries, or caching: read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
- Naming, domain or technical terms: read [docs/context.md](docs/context.md).
- Future application work: read [docs/reference/application.md](docs/reference/application.md).
- Surprising durable decisions: read [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Commands

Run Python from the repository root with `uv`. Do not activate `.venv` or call `python` directly.

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv sync --all-groups
```

After Python changes, run `uv run ruff check .` and relevant tests. `legacy` is excluded from Ruff; avoid incidental cleanup there.

## Scope and Safety

- `dataset` is private user data. Preserve it unless a request explicitly names an identity assignment, cache migration, or mutation. Never commit dataset contents, credentials, environment files, API keys, or model secrets.
- Preserve existing user changes. Check `git status --short` before editing and never revert unrelated work.
- Do not modernize `legacy` or `.curvrank_ref` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked. You must receive explicit confirmation before writing a commit.

## Active Architecture

- **domain** owns neutral immutable `Photo`, `Sighting`, and `SightingEarPair` values with permanent opaque UUID identity.
- **dataset** owns private metadata and known-elephant resolution; its **PhotoStore** resolves a `Photo` to original encoded bytes without exposing identity.
- **preparation** owns shared sighting preparation and immutable prepared-ear geometry.
- **inference** owns swappable implementations of ear localization, ear segmentation, and ear landmark detection.
- **matching** exposes the implementation-independent `CatalogMatcher` contract. Each algorithm owns its representations and scoring; `matching.alphaphant` exports `AlphaPhant` and owns AlphaTear extraction and similarity.
- **evaluation** owns implementation-independent identity-retrieval evaluation.
- **image** owns encoded-byte decoding, BGR images, and basic + universal geometry utilities.

Keep interfaces narrow and justified by current variation. Catalog matchers receive neutral domain objects and an image-only PhotoStore, never the identity-aware Dataset. Research supplies a sighting ear pair directly; future application ear selection remains upstream of the shared AlphaPhant pipeline.

Inject shared preparation directly into matchers. Keep fixed numerical settings beside their algorithms and composition limited to object construction. Evaluation owns manifests, folds, labels, and comparisons on actual candidate catalogs.

## Python Style

- Type every function and method signature.
- Give every package, module, class, function, and method a concise accurate Google-style docstring. Code in docstrings uses single backticks.
- Add `Args`, `Returns`, `Yields`, or `Raises` sections only when they clarify a non-obvious interface. Document validation errors that are part of the interface.
- Prefer clear names and structure over comments. Comment only non-trivial reasoning.
- Code should be clear enough that pipeline flow is obvious at a glance.
- Use `loguru` for logging. Library code never configures logging; entry points call `elephant_id.log.configure_logging` once.
- Log identifiers, counts, durations, and cache hits at appropriate levels. Never log credentials or raw image and mask buffers.
- Avoid over-engineering by making unnecessary abstractions or defensive guards that you don't need. Never hesitate to ask when in doubt.

## Images and Geometry

- `BgrImage` is the canonical in-memory image: HWC, BGR, `uint8`, OpenCV-native.
- PhotoStore returns encoded bytes. Decode them through the shared image-package OpenCV decoder at the image boundary. Avoid PIL/RGB conversions inside the package without a boundary reason.
- Float boxes use half-open `xyxy` coordinates. Convert to integer pixels only at raster boundaries through the image geometry helpers.
- OpenCV drawing endpoints are inclusive; draw a half-open box through `x2 - 1` and `y2 - 1`.
- Public color and background arguments are human-facing RGB; convert to BGR at the write boundary.
- COCO RLE uses `size=[height, width]` and string or byte counts. Decoded masks are two-dimensional boolean arrays.

## Caching

- One generic cache store serves immutable named producers and final per-ear tear profiles.
- Cache expensive computation, not orchestration.
- Use the permanent photo UUID directly for photo-level source identity. Add only actual dependent inputs such as crop coordinates; keep keys readable rather than hashing them again.
- A `producer_slug` carries model, weight, prompt, preprocessing, threshold, configuration, and algorithm identity. Any output-changing change gets a new immutable slug; those settings do not enter cache keys.
- Keep writes atomic and validate producer payloads on load.
- Select caching only through composition: inject a cached decorator or the raw processor. Analyzers and catalog matchers expose no cache-policy flags.
- Cache the complete SAM3 multi-feature computation before adapting it to the ear-only segmentation protocol. Cache landmark records in full-image coordinates.
- Preserve SAM3 body and complete multi-feature outputs and leave heuristic records untouched. Landmark records may be replaced when their coordinate contract changes. Age and gender records may be removed.

## Testing

- Test code under `src/elephant_id`; do not add unit tests for scripts or apps.
- Use small synthetic arrays and encoded images, fake PhotoStores and inference implementations, and recording cache/model clients.
- Unit tests never initialize real models, require network access, or depend on private photos.
- Characterize current numerical behavior before moving tear-profile or matching code.
- Add focused tests when changing validation, geometry, cache keys, serialization, dataset ordering, catalog aggregation, or evaluation splits.

## Git

- Keep changes scoped to the request and report noteworthy out-of-scope issues.
- Commit messages use imperative style without conventional prefixes.
- Browser or Playwright verification always runs in a subagent and only when necessary.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default role strings recorded as a `Status:` line. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: glossary at `docs/context.md`, ADRs at `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
